# Relational Match-To-Sample in Large Language Models

This repository tests the ability of GPT-3 (and related models) to complete Relational Match-to-Sample tasks (RMTS; see Premack, 1983). The ability to engage in the sort of relational reasoning needed to solve such tasks has been hypothesized as the core of uniquely human intelligene (Penn, Holyoak, & Povinelli, 2008), perhaps shared only partly with Primates such as Chimpanzees. However, new findings regarding the emergent analogical reasoning abilites of LLMs like GPT-3 suggest this may now be shared with non-organic systems (Webb, Lu, & Holyoak, 2023).

## RMTS task example

Consider the task below:

[apple] [apple]
[orange] [ ? ]

a. orange
b. apple

The pair {apple, apple} instantiates an instance of the "same" relation, and so the correct (relational) answer is "a", which would instantiate a matching relation. However, a tempting "surface-similar" lure is "b", which appears in the initial pair.
